Spaceman Spiff's C64 USB keyboard
=================================

This document contains various bits of information that may come in handy if
one wants to study the function of the developed Commodore 64 USB keyboard.

Spaceman Spiff's Commodore 64 USB keyboard (or c64key for short) is an 
implementation of a low-speed USB HID device, implementing a keyboard.
The physical appearance of the device is that of a Commodore 64 "breadbox",
but the device works as a USB keyboard that can be used with a PC.

The C64 keyboard consists of 66 keys, where the restore-key is special in
that it was hardwired to the NMI-pin of the 6510 in the C64. The remaining
keys are organized in a matrix with 8 rows and 8 columns, and with the SHIFT
LOCK key wired in parallel to the left SHIFT-key.


Keyboard matrix decoding
------------------------

The keyboard matrix is decoded by scanning the rows. One by one, the row pins
on the microcontroller are configured as outputs, and with a low value (0V).
The other row drivers are configured as inputs.

The column inputs are also configured as inputs, and with the internal pull-
up resistors enabled. Each column is read in turn and compared to the last 
values (which are stored in a buffer). When a change is detected, a debounce 
counter is activated, which will require a number of consecutive reads to all
return the same value before a report is generated. This is required since 
the keys in the C64 keyboard matrix have a rather high amount of bounce, which
will sometimes result in more than one key-event for some key presses.

The scanning rate with the current configuration is about 2.2kHz, which is fast
enough that the delay caused by the debouncing is not noticable.

The keyboard matrix hardware of the C64 is quite simple, and the scanning 
routine is also simple, so no key blocking has been implemented. This means 
that ghosting can easily occur (if 3 keys are depressed at the same time,
a fourth scan-code may be generated, whose key was never pressed).


USB Keyboard limitations
------------------------

The USB HID keyboard specification has some limitations that became aparent
during the work with this project. Most notably, the limit on a HID report
is 8 bytes (due to the low-speed devices). Since the first byte is reserved 
for modifier keys, and on a normal keyboard, the second byte is reserved, we 
are left with a maximum of 6 bytes for the keycodes. In our case we do not 
need LED states, and so this byte is saved for another keycode. In other words 
it is not possible to create a USB HID keyboard that handles pressing more 
than 7 keys simultaneously (6 under normal circumstances) - apart from the up 
to 8 modifier keys. Clearly the keyboard is primarily meant as an input-device
for typing text, and not as a game controller. While the AT and PS/2 keyboard
protocol does not have this limitation, since it sends scancodes for each key
pressed and released, other limitations apply here, such as the keyboard 
controller scanning the keys, and the decoding on the PC side. It is therefore
not clear if PS/2 keyboards are better in this respect, but the USB HID
specification imposes a limit that does not exist with PS/2, so it is at least
theoretically possible to make a PS/2 keyboard that can handle more simulteneous
keypresses.

Since the scanning of the keyboard in our implementation (the c64key) is very
simple, and does not cope with ghosting, we do not regard this as a big 
disadvantage for our application, but it should be considered if a different
type of controller may be more appropriate for a given application.

That said, it is anticipated that the c64key can prove useful in many cases
where a more advanced input device is needed (compared to the HIDkeys demo
application on which this is based). Changes to the method of scanning should
be easily achievable.


Special key handling
--------------------

In order to get the most accurate emulation of the C64 keyboard when used with
a PC, some special key handling has been implemented. The idea is to achieve
the correct symbol (e.g. the one on the keytop) to appear on the screen, even
though the mapping to PC scan-codes in unshifted and shifted states is not
straight forward. 

Unfortunately the USB keyboard does not send the character code, but rather a
scan-code, similar to older keyboards, and the PC maps these to characters
(or functions) based on the current keyboard map.

In order to implement this, the keyboard map array has some special entries
(starting with SPC_) which are handled by a special lookup table. The table
contains the scan-code to generate, as well as some bits signifying if the
modifier keys should be altered. 

Unfortunately this approach means the modifier keys may be messed up if a 
special key is pressed in combination with another key. In other words the
system works fine as long as only one key is pressed at a time (perhaps 
along with a modifyer).


Modifier key mapping
--------------------

Due to the difference in available modifier keys on a Commodore 64 and a
standard PC keyboard, the following mapping has been defined. The modifier
keys are decoded along with the other keys, and their mapping may be changed
in the keymap-array defined in keycodes.h. Notice, however, that some special
decoding of the shift-keys is done in main.c, in order to handle the special
keys that need to generate different scan-codes based on the state of the
modifiers, or change the modifier mask.

Modifier key mappings:
LSHIFT              Left shift
SHIFT LOCK          Left shift
CTRL                Left CTRL
C=                  Left ALT
RUN/STOP            Right ALT
RSHIFT              Right shift
RESTORE             Right CTRL

For the cursor keys and the F-keys, the right shift-key will select alternate
function, while the left shift-key is passed through. This allows selection by
holding the left shift key and using the cursor-keys (and the right-shift to
alter the direction of movement). It also allows the even F-keys to be selected
(by using RSHIFT + F-key), while the left shift key is passed through. So pressing
RSHIFT+F7 yields F8, and LSHIFT+RSHIFT+F7 yields SHIFT+F8. C= + RSHIFT + F3 is
Alt-F4.

are mapped into the 8x8 matrix (with the SHIFT LOCK key connected in parallel with
the left SHIFT key).


C64 keyboard matrix
-------------------

The table below contains the mapping of the C64 keyboard matrix. The table has
been organized based on the row/column numbers used internally in the C64 (and
also in the c64key project), but does not correspond to the wiring used in the
C64 keyboard matrix connector.

   6            F5      E       T       U       O       @       ^       Q
   7         CRSR DU  L shift   X       V       N       ,       /    RUN/STOP


The Danish keyboard mapping
---------------------------

The Danish keyboard mapping is created to utilize the C64 USB keyboard with 
Danish keytops for a PC with a Danish keyboard configuration. It should be possible
to make an updated keycodes.h-file with other key-to-scancode translation, which
will allow an unmodified C64 keyboard to be used, or allow the generated scan-codes
to be in a format suitable for other keyboard mappings on the PC side.

The following C64 keys have replaced keytops on the Danish version:
Normal C64 key        unshifted        shifted
      0                   0               @
      -                   -               =
      £                   :               :
      @                   å               Å
      :                   æ               Æ
      ;                   ø               Ø
      =                   ;               ;
